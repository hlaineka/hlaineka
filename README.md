I am currently working on creating a shell with a group. You can find the repo of our project on [21sh](https://github.com/hlaineka/21sh)

My earlier projects: 
 - ft_select, a small program using termcaps library to create an interface.[ft_select](https://github.com/hlaineka/ft_select)
 - minishell, the first shell project creating a simple command interpreter. [minishell](https://github.com/hlaineka/minishell)
