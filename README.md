### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a full-stack developer with passion for usability and accessability. Most of my projects here in github are quite old, from the days I studied in Hive.

- My latest project, a recruitment project for Solita - [The Bike App](https://github.com/hlaineka/dev-academy-2023-exercise) deployed [here](https://hlaineka.github.io/dev-academy-2023-exercise/) (the free server might be offline)

My earlier projects: 
 - A working shell in C in a group of two. The parser is my work. You can find the repo of our project at [21sh](https://github.com/hlaineka/21sh) and the finished project [42sh](https://github.com/hlaineka/42sh)
 - One week crash course to python by creating an evaluation grading system by using data from our school API [evaluation review](https://github.com/hlaineka/evaluation_review)
 - ft_select, a small program using termcaps library to create an interface.[ft_select](https://github.com/hlaineka/ft_select)
 - minishell, the first shell project creating a simple command interpreter. [minishell](https://github.com/hlaineka/minishell)
 - ft_ls, a redo of the ls command. [ft_ls](https://github.com/hlaineka/ft_ls)

See also our demo of our Hack the Crisis winning idea of a remote learning platform for small students [Kauko app demo](https://whispering-anchorage-96723.herokuapp.com/). More info on the process of creating the demo can be found on [Hive Helsinki homepage](https://www.hive.fi/en/article/student-project-kauko-app/)
